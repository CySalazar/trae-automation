- **Advanced OCR Processing**: Multiple image enhancement techniques for improved text detection accuracy
- **Intelligent Click Automation**: Safe coordinate validation and automatic clicking with retry mechanisms
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and retry logic
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time statistics and performance tracking
- **Configurable Settings**: Easily customizable scan intervals, retry limits, and detection patterns
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging system with timestamps and performance metrics
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code structure with separated responsibilities

## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (primary support)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tesseract OCR installed
- Screen resolution: 1920x1080 or higher (recommended)

### Python Dependencies
- `pyautogui>=0.9.54` - Screen capture and mouse automation
- `pytesseract>=0.3.13` - OCR text extraction
- `Pillow>=10.0.0` - Image processing
- `opencv-python>=4.8.0` - Advanced image enhancement
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - Numerical operations for image processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Install Tesseract OCR

Download and install Tesseract OCR from the official repository:
- Visit: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Download the Windows installer
- Install to the default location: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\`

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd detect-continue
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Run the system validation:

```bash
python detect.py --validate
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The system can be configured by modifying `config.py`:

### Key Configuration Options

```python
# Scanning interval (seconds)
SCAN_INTERVAL = 120  # Scan every 2 minutes

# Target text pattern (regex)
TARGET_PATTERN = r'continue'
TARGET_END_WORD = 'continue'

# Retry configurations
MAX_RETRIES = 3
RETRY_DELAY = 5  # seconds

# Failure handling
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES = 5
EXTENDED_WAIT_TIME = 300  # 5 minutes

# OCR confidence threshold
MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 30
```

### Tesseract Path Configuration

If Tesseract is installed in a non-standard location, update the path in `config.py`:

```python
TESSERACT_CMD = r'C:\Your\Custom\Path\tesseract.exe'
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

Start the automatic detection system:

```bash
python detect.py
```

The system will:
1. Initialize all components
2. Start continuous screen monitoring
3. Scan for the target pattern every 2 minutes
4. Automatically click when the pattern is detected
5. Log all activities with timestamps

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Run with debug logging
python detect.py --debug

# Validate system requirements
python detect.py --validate

# Run single scan (for testing)
python detect.py --single-scan
```

### Stopping the System

- **Keyboard Interrupt**: Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop
- **Emergency Stop**: Move mouse to top-left corner (failsafe)
- **System Shutdown**: The system will automatically stop on system shutdown

## üìä Monitoring and Logs

### Log Files

The system creates detailed logs in:
- `automation_log.txt` - Main activity log with timestamps
- Console output - Real-time status updates

### Performance Statistics

The system tracks:
- Total scans performed
- Successful detections
- Click success rate
- Average scan time
- System uptime
- Error rates

### Status Reports

Automatic status reports are generated every 10 scans, including:
- System health status
- Performance metrics
- Recent activity summary

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

```
detect.py              # Main entry point and orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py          # Global configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.py          # Logging and statistics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scanner.py         # Main scanning logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image_processing.py # Image capture and enhancement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ocr_engine.py      # Text extraction and processing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coordinate_manager.py # Click automation and validation
```

### Key Components

- **Scanner**: Orchestrates the scanning process and handles retries
- **Image Processing**: Captures screenshots and applies enhancement filters
- **OCR Engine**: Extracts text using multiple OCR configurations
- **Coordinate Manager**: Validates coordinates and performs safe clicks
- **Logger**: Comprehensive logging and performance monitoring

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tesseract not found**
```
Error: Tesseract not found
Solution: Verify Tesseract installation and update TESSERACT_CMD path
```

**Permission denied for screenshots**
```
Error: Screenshot capture failed
Solution: Run as administrator or check screen capture permissions
```

**High CPU usage**
```
Issue: Continuous high CPU usage
Solution: Increase SCAN_INTERVAL in config.py
```

**False positive detections**
```
Issue: Clicking on wrong elements
Solution: Adjust TARGET_PATTERN regex or increase MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```bash
python detect.py --debug
```

This will provide:
- Detailed OCR results
- Image processing steps
- Coordinate validation details
- Performance timing information

## üîí Safety Features

- **Failsafe Protection**: Move mouse to corner to emergency stop
- **Coordinate Validation**: Ensures clicks are within screen bounds
- **Retry Limits**: Prevents infinite retry loops
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of system errors
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic detection of system health issues

## üìà Performance Optimization

### For Better Accuracy
- Ensure good screen contrast
- Use standard fonts when possible
- Avoid overlapping windows
- Maintain consistent screen resolution

### For Better Performance
- Increase scan intervals for less frequent checking
- Adjust OCR confidence thresholds
- Monitor system resource usage
- Use SSD storage for faster image processing
